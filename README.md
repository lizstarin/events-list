# Events list 

## Start guide:

- Open ```index.html``` in a browser. That's it!

## To do:

- Improve styling . . . a LOT!

- Test layout on different devices

- Test layout in older browsers

- Write backend to rotate public token (consider making API call from backend)

- jQuery, maybe?

- Fancy UI stuff: hovering on an event in the list should show the event's popup on the map (for example)

- ZIP filter
